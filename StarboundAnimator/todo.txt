TODO :

control boxes for the frameList frames only

need to allow clicking and dragging of control boxes where appropriate
 - on frameitem

need a context menu popup to add/change/remove frames by right clicking on a frame

need to sort out changing frameGrid properties populating back to the frames object

need to add an image button to allow setting an arbitrary image for a background

need to implement processing List source frames from JSON and throughout editor code

what about using different colors for the rects around frameitems based on source?

when editing frames, it's important that aliases don't desync with what they're aliasing

need to figure out the best way to edit the names member
 - fucking multi-dimensional arrays.

need to figure out how to smartly edit frameList and aliases

need to start on reading/writing the JSON format for the files
 - it appears that there are multiple methods to define sprites with .frames files
   - need to figure out how to unify the definition methods to a single native implementation

when changing the image name in properties, need to load the new image name

removing an asset path needs to scan for loaded assets and check whether or not to unload them
 - this is going to rely on a contentmanager, so that needs to be done first

tabSource needs to present two refresh options :
 - refresh from file
 - generate from editor

need an option to refresh/rescan the assets lists
 - right click menu in Assets tree should give the option to rescan (if root) or refresh (if not root)

loading resources should happen whenever an asset is opened
resources loaded by assets that aren't used by anything else should be unloaded

need a project file format
 - animations and frames can either be native to the project or referenced in-place

allow user to change background color of render area

need to support unpacking Starbound assets also
 - when doing this, ask the user if they want to set the unpacking directory to the stock assets directory list

need to have zooming change the center of the screen (affect translation)

I also don't like the current VScrollBar. Make it look like a slider, damnit.
