TODO :

Lua parsing
- need to stub loading globals
- need a way to know what individual characters are classified as
  - whitespace (space)
  - operators
  - letters and numbers

EditorPanel needs to be abstracted to then be the parent of :
- FramesEditorPanel
- AnimationEditorPanel

Option to create a frames file from an image file
- bring up a dialog box for setting grid properties
- 

removing an asset path needs to scan for loaded assets and check whether or not to unload them
 - this is going to rely on a contentmanager, so that needs to be done first

loading resources should happen whenever an asset is opened
resources loaded by assets that aren't used by anything else should be unloaded

allow user to change background color of render area

need to start on reading/writing the JSON format for the files
 - need to start thinking about how to handle the different animation formats

need to have zooming change the center of the screen (affect translation)

when deleting frames
- same for Name (disable the view option for it)
  - no good way to check for existing names (a part of frameGrid, so nope)

I also don't like the current VScrollBar on the frames editor interface. Make it look like a slider, damnit.
