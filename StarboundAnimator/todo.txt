TODO :

if using frameGrid, draw the grid
when drawing the grid, need to write names that use that grid
 - different name sources need to be colored

need a checkbox button for drawing frameGrid or frameList
 - these toggle one or the other like radiobuttons

need a textbox for when mouse passes over a frame
 - display name of frame, clicking should allow renaming of frame and resizing (if frameList)

need to figure out the best way to edit the names member
 - fucking multi-dimensional arrays.

need to figure out how to smartly edit frameList and aliases

need to start on reading/writing the JSON format for the files
 - it appears that there are multiple methods to define sprites with .frames files
   - need to figure out how to unify the definition methods to a single native implementation

when changing the image name in properties, need to load the new image name

removing an asset path needs to scan for loaded assets and check whether or not to unload them
 - this is going to rely on a contentmanager, so that needs to be done first

tabSource needs to present two refresh options :
 - refresh from file
 - generate from editor

need an option to refresh/rescan the assets lists
 - right click menu in Assets tree should give the option to rescan (if root) or refresh (if not root)

loading resources should happen whenever an asset is opened
resources loaded by assets that aren't used by anything else should be unloaded

need a project file format
 - animations and frames can either be native to the project or referenced in-place

allow user to change background color of render area

need to support unpacking Starbound assets also
 - when doing this, ask the user if they want to set the unpacking directory to the stock assets directory list

need to have zooming change the center of the screen (affect translation)

I also don't like the current VScrollBar. Make it look like a slider, damnit.
