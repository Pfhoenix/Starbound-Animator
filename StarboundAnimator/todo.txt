TODO :

Lua parsing
- definition log parsing doesn't account for sub-tables yet
- need to stub loading globals
- multi-line comment/string coloring isn't working right yet
  - need a separate TextSymbol for comment end and string end

Right now, tabs are a little confusing
- are they list of open documents? should they be?
- does it make sense to have only one of each asset type open at a time?
- switching between tabs should set the currently visible specialized menu option

EditorPanel needs to be abstracted to then be the parent of :
- FramesEditorPanel
- AnimationEditorPanel

Option to create a frames file from an image file
- bring up a dialog box for setting grid properties
- 

removing an asset path needs to scan for loaded assets and check whether or not to unload them
 - this is going to rely on a contentmanager, so that needs to be done first

loading resources should happen whenever an asset is opened
resources loaded by assets that aren't used by anything else should be unloaded

allow user to change background color of render area

need to start on reading/writing the JSON format for the files
 - need to start thinking about how to handle the different animation formats

need to have zooming change the center of the screen (affect translation)

when deleting frames
- same for Name (disable the view option for it)
  - no good way to check for existing names (a part of frameGrid, so nope)

I also don't like the current VScrollBar on the frames editor interface. Make it look like a slider, damnit.
