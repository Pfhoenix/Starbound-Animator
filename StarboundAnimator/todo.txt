TODO :

need a way to tie animation and frames objects to their representative TreeNodes

removing an asset path needs to scan for loaded assets and check whether or not to unload them
 - this is going to rely on a contentmanager, so that needs to be done first

need a config file
 - list of directories to scan for stock animation and frame files
 - cached list of stock assets locations to quickly build asset tree

need an option to refresh/rescan the assets lists
 - right click menu in Assets tree should give the option to rescan (if root) or refresh (if not root)

loading resources should happen whenever an asset is opened
resources loaded by assets that aren't used by anything else should be unloaded

need a project file format
 - animations and frames can either be native to the project or referenced in-place

allow user to change background color of render area

need to support unpacking Starbound assets also
 - when doing this, ask the user if they want to set the unpacking directory to the stock assets directory list
